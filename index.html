  <h2>About ExitFinders</h2>
  <p>ExitFinders is your dedicated partner in navigating the complex journey of selling a business. Whether you’re planning retirement, exploring a new venture, or ready to cash out on your hard work, we begin by pinpointing your company’s true market value and crafting a tailored exit strategy designed around your timeline and goals. Leveraging an extensive, confidential network of qualified buyers, we discreetly market your opportunity so you can protect employee morale and customer confidence from day one.

From the moment a letter of intent lands on your desk through due diligence and closing, we negotiate terms that maximize your proceeds while minimizing risk. We handle every detail—deal structuring, legal review, tax planning, and transition coordination—so you can focus on what matters most. With transparent communication and a single point of contact, you’ll always know where things stand and what the next steps are.

We strive for sale prices above market averages and, more importantly, we assure that you walk away satisfied, rather than stressed. At ExitFinders, we believe every business exit should be smooth, profitable, and rewarding.</p>

  <h2>Our Team</h2>
  <p>We are a team of finance majors at Boise State University—Caden Economos, Tyler Afdahl, and Luke Winchester, we specialize in helping business owners connect with the right buyers. Drawing on rigorous financial analysis, market valuation techniques, and hands‑on deal structuring experience, we guide you through every phase of the exit process. We strive ensure your company’s value is maximized and the transition is seamless. Away from the office, We love getting outside—whether it’s camping, hitting the golf course, or casting a line at dawn. That same sense of adventure and teamwork fuels how we guide you through selling your business.</p>
